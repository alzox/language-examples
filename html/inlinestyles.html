<!-- 
Styles should be added with css classes, queries, or id selectors, this is only being done to show the scope of customizations and some interesting things that are possible with styling in html.

Styles are mainly categorized into:
text - what the text in the tag looks like
space - how much a tag takes up
positioning - where it is placed (position, transform)
flex/grid - used for flex and grid layouts
psuedo - special misc ones like hover or before
list/tables - styles specific to those tags
